    `Greetings! Welcome to my website celebrating the storied history and art that is scotch whisky. As an avid enthusiast of whisky, I (like many others) found myself overwhelmed by the vast landscape of scotch. I built this website in an effort to expand my knowledge of this exquisite drink, as well as demonstrate my continued learnings in web development.`,
    `In this website you'll find some neat (no pun intended) resources on the history, production, and types of scotch whisky. The Scotch Database can be used to filter hundreds of scotch whiskies based on name, price, and flavor profile. You can also provide some feedback in our Visitor Survey.`,
    `I hope you find this website fun and informative. Cheers!`,

    `Hi! I'm Chris.`,
    `I've spent my professional career working in various tech jobs, but just recently started learning how to be a full-stack developer myself. This is one of many websites I built to practice web development. This website was built using the MERN stack, specifically the next.js framework and the Material UI component library.`,
    `As far as scotch goes, I can't say it's my preferred drink of choice, but it's definitely one of my favorites. I think my friends Garrett and Frank first turned me on to Talisker sometime in college, and then I gradually began branching out and trying more scotch on my own. To this day, Talisker is still one of my favorite brands.`,
    `I was fortunate enough to visit Scotland in 2016, but didn't have enough time to do a proper distillery crawl. I hope to visit sometime in the future and really do it right.`,
    `Anyhoo - I hope you found some value in visiting my silly little site. Hopefully you got something out of it, and maybe are preparing to pour yourself a glass of scotch at this very moment. As the Scottish writer David Daiches once said - "The proper drinking of Scotch whisky is more than indulgence: it is a toast to civilization, a tribute to the continuity of culture, a manifesto of manâ€™s determination to use the resources of nature to refresh mind and body and enjoy to the full the senses with which he has been endowed."`,
